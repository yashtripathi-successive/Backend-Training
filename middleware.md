# Middleware and Its Usage

## What is Middleware?

Middleware is software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications, especially on a network. In the context of web development, middleware refers to functions or software components that sit between the client request and the server response. Middleware functions have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.

Middleware can perform various tasks such as:

- Executing code
- Modifying the request and response objects
- Ending the request-response cycle
- Calling the next middleware function in the stack

## Types of Middleware

1. **Application-level Middleware**  
   These middleware functions are bound to an instance of the application and can be used for tasks such as logging, authentication, or parsing request bodies.

2. **Router-level Middleware**  
   Middleware bound to an instance of the router. Useful for modularizing routes.

3. **Error-handling Middleware**  
   Middleware specifically designed to handle errors in the request-response cycle. It has four parameters: `(err, req, res, next)`.

4. **Built-in Middleware**  
   Middleware provided by frameworks or platforms, e.g., Express's `express.json()` or `express.static()`.

5. **Third-party Middleware**  
   Middleware created by the community to handle tasks like cookies, sessions, CORS, etc.
